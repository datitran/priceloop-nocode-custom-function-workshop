# Priceloop NoCode - Custom Function Workshop

In this workshop, we want to build a simple use case together on [Priceloop NoCode](https://alpha.priceloop.ai/). In order to be effective please do this before:

- Please already create an account at https://alpha.priceloop.ai/
- You can play around with it already like creating a new table, creating a formula etc. or also check our docs at https://docs.priceloop.ai/
- Please install our CLI on your machine via `npm`:
```
npm install -g @priceloop/cli
```
- Make sure that you also have a Python package manager installed like `pip` or `conda` and already create a Python 3.8 environment
```
conda create -n my_example python=3.8
source activate my_example
```
